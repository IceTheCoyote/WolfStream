# WolfStream
Wolf Stream [Uses MySQL and PHP]

# What is Wolf Stream?
Wolf stream consist of three things needed.

1. You'll need Apache/MySQL
2. And MonaServer. Search in google "MonaServer" or any rtmp server of your choosing.

# How do I set it up?
Ok so in order for you to even start this you will need monaserver.exe and apache2/mysql before starting. Doing without monaserver/any rtmp server, will render this useless...

# How do I access/edit my admin page?
You can do so by this obvious admin.php page which you will need of course to administrate your users.
